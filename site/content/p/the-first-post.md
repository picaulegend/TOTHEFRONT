Officially this is my first post on TOTHEFRONT. The site is online. And that's important. I don't have the domain yet, nor is the layout ready, but that doesn't matter. I'm trying to stay away from only putting stuff out until it's perfect, because too many times that led to abandoning a project completely. And if I learned anything it's that something grows day by day. Things aren't suddenly there in Super Saiyan 4 form.

That doesn't mean I'll just put out whatever. I have standards. And I should demand of myself that whatever I write or work on should be something I can get behind. But that holy treshold I can reach publicly. I feel increasingly it's fine to just start with the beginning and then let that be the beginning for all to see.

Great things grow with feedback, scrutiny and support. If there's nothing to comment on, then all I'll have is my own viewpoint, and that won't cut it. 

I hope to be able to commit something each day to the public repo and public site.
