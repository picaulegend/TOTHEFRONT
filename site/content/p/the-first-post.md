This is my first official post on TOTHEFRONT. The site is online, it works, and that's important. I don't have the domain yet, nor is the layout ready, but that doesn't matter for now. I'm trying to stay away from only putting stuff out until it's perfect, because too many times that has led to abandoning a project completely. And if I learned anything it's that something grows day by day. Things aren't suddenly there in Super Saiyan 4 form. They need time and consistent attention.

That doesn't mean I'll just put out whatever; I have standards. I should demand of myself that whatever I write or work on should end up to be something I can get behind. But that holy treshold I can reach publicly. I feel increasingly that it's fine to just start with the beginning and then let that be the beginning for all to see.

In tech they call that a minimum viable product. Kanye West would just call it an album. It's a version of the intended product that has the core functionality, but isn't necessarily scalable, stable or polished. The idea is to put out something fast so you build momentum, get to the market first and can adjust your product to reality by having it out there for people to interact with.

It's dangerous to solely develop ideas and products in a sterile controlled space that can only mimic reality. So the earlier you can introduce actual reality, the better. It's very much like exclusively relying on practice sessions

Errors only show up when you bump into them. And once you are aware of the error, you can start fixing them.

Great things grow with feedback, scrutiny and support. If there's nothing to comment on, then all I'll have is my own viewpoint, and that won't cut it. 

I hope to be able to commit something each day to the repo, and thus to the site. I figure that if I'm able to do something small many times, it will eventually end up to be something big.
