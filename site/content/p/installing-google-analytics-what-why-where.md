When you have your site in the air, it's time to track who's coming through. There are some options for tracking visitors, but Google Analytics is the number one choice. Unless, you have principal objections to using a Google product, I would recommend setting up an account by heading on over to https://www.google.nl/intl/nl/analytics/.

Google Analytics is a web analysis and reporting tool. It has loads of options and in conjuction with Google Tag Manager, another Google service, you could virtually track anything on your website. So you'd know how many people visit your site, where they are from, how they ended up on your page, which pages they landed on.

Aside from satiating the curiosity of knowing what people were doing on your site, the information Google Analytics provides can also help you make better decision about your site. I'm not saying your instincts, wisdom and vision are not enough to build a superb webpage, but it's truly interesting what kinds of numbers Google Analytics can generate for you.

## How to install
Let's install this thing first. In its most basic form it's nothing more than a Javascript snippet you copy from you Google Analytics account to your website. You need to paste it in your HTML, so I really hope you know what HTML is.

Google recommends pasting it high up in the '<head>' of your site before any CSS you might want to load into your site. And make sure you paste it on every page on your site. Not just the index.html or whatever you called your page.
