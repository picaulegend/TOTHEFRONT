The Victor Hugo boilerplate is a fine foundation for any Hugo blog. It has a solid Gulp configuration that does a lot of the basis functionality you might come to expect in front-end development. However Gulp is powerful and boasts many plugins. With the latest commit I've added a few plugins to add extra optimization to my site.

What I've added and why:
Code concatication
Code optimization
Image optimization



To get a quick primer and hands-on tutorial, check out Zell's Gulp tutorial.

What I added:
